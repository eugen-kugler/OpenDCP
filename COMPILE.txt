OpenDCP
------------
This program builds the XML files for Digital Cinema Packages. 

Requirements
------------
The program requires the following libraries.
 
  - AS-DCP File Access Library (http://www.cinecert.com/asdcplib/)
  - OpenSSL (http://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/crypto.html)
  - LibXML2 (http://xmlsoft.org/) [optional - if you want XML signatures]
  - LibXSLT (http://xmlsoft.org/) [optional - if you want XML signatures]
  - LibXMLSec (http://www.aleksey.com/xmlsec/) [optional - if you want XML signatures]
  - LibTIFF (http://www.libtiff.org/)
  - OpenJPEG (http://www.openjpeg.org)

Mac OS X and many linux distributions already have OpenSSL (libcrypto) installed.

Cmake
------------
CMake is used to build this application. You may need to install CMake.
Most linux distributions have CMake installed or have it available through the package manager.
On Mac OSX, CMake is easily installed with MacPorts.

Compile
------------
It is recommended you perform an out-of-source build. This will prevent cluttering the source directory.
This can be performed from anywhere, just give cmake the path to the root directory of the OpenDCP source.

For example, if the OpenDCP source is in /home/opendcp, but you want to build in /home/opendcp-build

# cd /home/opendcp-build
# cmake /home/opendcp/

If you want to statically link OpenDCP, you can in the ENABLE_STATIC flag

# cmake -DENABLE_STATIC=ON /home/opendcp

Once cmake completes, you should have the necessary make files. To compile issue the make command.

# make

You should end up with opendcp_xml, opendcp_xml, opendcp_j2k in a directory called build.

Install
------------
You can install OpenDCP so you can invoke the command from anywhere.

# make install

Static Notes
------------
Static libraries are included for OSX 10.6 64-bit and WIN32. In Linux or OSX 10.5.x you need to download
compile, and install the appropiate libraries and compile dynamically. Most of the libraries, execpt AS-DCP
can be install using your linux package manager or mac ports on OSX.

The libraries included were compiled as follows:

AS-DCP
./configure --with-expat --with-openssl
